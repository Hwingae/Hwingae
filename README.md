- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hwingae
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Programming in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently in basic level, learning some methematics.
- 💞️ I'm working on team project in game making club & projects in university.
- 📫 How to reach me ...Maybe later, I'm not professional for now & need to study more haha.

I'm new to Github, so there's few stuffs in my repository.
But I hope you can find something useful from me if you're here for it!

====================================================================================================================================

I'm learning, focusing on:
- Game methematics

And I'm learning these too, but rather slowly:
- Unity (About more freatures)
- Unreal (Basic level)
- C++ (for recalling)

====================================================================================================================================

I'm currently working on:

- Great Aim (Game making club project): Simple FPS game with multiplayer. I'm working on the client level, especially with gun.
- Mystic Farm (Personal project): 2D farm simulation game. I'm making it rather slowly.
- (Upcoming project): Capstone design project. Currently in planning.
- (Upcoming project): For my friend in Germany. Visual Novel genre. We're currently planning storyline.

Thank you! <:3 )~
