- 👋 Hi, I’m @YiEun (aka Hwingae(HG)/WD as nickname)
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Programming in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently in basic level, learning some methematics.
- 💞️ I'm working on team project in game making club & projects in university.

============================================================================

I'm learning, focusing on:
- Algorithm (solving on various platforms, including HackerRank)

And I'm learning these too, but rather slowly:
- Unity (About more freatures)
- Unreal (Basic level)
- C++ (for recalling)
- Game methematics

============================================================================

I'm currently working on:

- Great Aim (Game making club project): Simple FPS game with multiplayer. I'm working on the client level, especially with gun.
- Mystic Farm (Personal project): 2D farm simulation game. I'm making it rather slowly.
- (Upcoming project): Capstone design project. Currently in planning.
- (Upcoming project): For my friend in Germany. Visual Novel genre. We're currently planning storyline.

============================================================================

Thank you! <:3 )~
